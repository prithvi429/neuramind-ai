# NeuraMind AI Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the NeuraMind AI system, detailing its components and how they interact.

## System Overview

NeuraMind AI is a modular multi-agent system designed to handle tasks like navigation, content generation, image processing, and financial analysis. Each agent operates independently but collaborates through a central backend.

## Components

- **Frontend**: React-based UI for user interaction.
- **Backend**: Flask server coordinating agent tasks.
- **Agents**: Specialized modules for specific functionalities.
- **Data**: Stores prompts and other resources.

## Workflow

1. User interacts with the frontend.
2. Backend routes requests to the appropriate agent.
3. Agents perform tasks and return results.
4. Frontend displays the results.
